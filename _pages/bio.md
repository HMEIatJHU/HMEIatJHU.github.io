Hongyuan Mei is currently a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC). 
<!-- He is broadly interested in developing machine learning methods for reasoning about real-world events.  -->
His research spans machine learning and natural language processing. 
Currently, he is most interested in 
- developing neural and neuro-symbolic models for time series; 
- harnessing and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models; 
- building world models that learn from real-world interactions. 

His research has been supported by a Bloomberg Data Science PhD Fellowship, the 2020 JHU Jelinek Memorial Award, and research gifts from Adobe and Ant Group. 
His technical innovations have been integrated into real-world applications such as Alipay, the worldâ€™s largest mobile digital payment platform, which serves more than one billion users.
His research has been covered by [Fortune Magazine](https://fortune.com/2020/09/08/disco-bell-bottoms-big-hair-and-cutting-edge-a-i/) and [Tech At Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/icml-2020-bloomberg-ph-d-fellow-combines-datalog-and-neural-networks-to-model-dynamic-databases/). 

<!-- His research goal is to enable computers to reason about the real world.  -->
<!-- His current focus is to develop machine learning models and algorithms for time series modeling and natural language understanding.  -->

Hongyuan Mei obtained his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), where he was advised by Jason Eisner. 
He was a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP). 
At JHU, he collaborated with Yanxun Xu from Applied Math & Statistics as well as Benjamin Van Durme and Kevin Duh from Computer Science.

Before joining JHU and CLSP, Hongyuan Mei obtained two MS degrees 
<!---(in Physical Science and Financial Mathematics)-->
from University of Chicago, 
and did research in natural language processing with Mohit Bansal and Matthew R. Walter at TTIC. 
Prior to that, he obtained a BE in Electrical Engineering and a BA in Finance from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
