Hongyuan Mei is currently a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC). 
His research interests are rooted in designing machine learning models and algorithms to solve challenging real-world problems.
His current focus is modelling sequential data, which is essential in time-stamped event prediction and natural language understanding. 

Hongyuan Mei obtained his PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), where he was advised by Jason Eisner. 
His PhD research was supported by Bloomberg Data Science PhD Fellowship, and covered by [Fortune Magazine](https://fortune.com/2020/09/08/disco-bell-bottoms-big-hair-and-cutting-edge-a-i/) and [Tech At Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/icml-2020-bloomberg-ph-d-fellow-combines-datalog-and-neural-networks-to-model-dynamic-databases/). 
He was a member of the Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP), and the 2020 recipient for the Jelinek Fellowship. 
At JHU, he collaborated with Yanxun Xu from Applied Math & Statistics as well as Benjamin Van Durme and Kevin Duh from Computer Science.

Befor joining JHU and CLSP, Hongyuan Mei obtained two MS degrees 
<!---(in Physical Science and Financial Mathematics)-->
from The University of Chicago, 
and did research in natural language understanding and generation with Mohit Bansal and Matthew R. Walter at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago. 
Prior to that, he obtained a BE in Electrical Engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
