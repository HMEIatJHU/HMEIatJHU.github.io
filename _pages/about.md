<!-- I am a computer scientist.  -->
<!-- I am currently a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC).  -->
I develop machine learning methods for reasoning about real-world events. 
My research spans machine learning and natural language processing. 
Currently, I am most interested in 
- developing neural and neuro-symbolic models for time series; 
- harnessing and improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models; 
- building world models that learn from real-world interactions.
