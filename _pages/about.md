I am a computer scientist. 
I am currently working as a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC). 
My research interests are rooted in designing machine learning models and algorithms to solve challenging real-world problems.
My current focus is modelling sequential data, which is essential in time-stamped event prediction and natural language understanding. 

**I am looking for talented undergrad/Masters/PhD students to work with on research projects about modeling time series and human natural languages. If you are interested, please reach out to me.**
