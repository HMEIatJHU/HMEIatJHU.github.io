I am a computer scientist. 
I am currently working as a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC). 
My research interests are rooted in designing machine learning models and algorithms to solve challenging real-world problems.
My current focus is to enable computers to reason about the real world, which involves time series modeling and natural language understanding. 

**I am looking for talented undergrad/Masters/PhD students to work with on interesting research projects. Please read [this post]({{ '/recruitment/' | relative_url }}) for more details.**
