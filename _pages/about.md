I am a computer scientist. 
I am currently working as a Research Assistant Professor at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC). 
My research goal is to enable computers to reason about the real world. 
To achieve this goal, I develop machine learning models and algorithms for time series modeling and natural language understanding.
