Welcome! Thank you for your interest in working with me. 

I am looking for 1--2 research assistants to work with me. My previous RAs all had opportunities to publish papers at top conferences (e.g., NeurIPS and EMNLP) during undergrad or masters study, and they all got PhD offers from strong CS/NLP schools. If you are interested, please send your CVs to me at <hongyuan@ttic.edu>. 

For this research project, we will specifically work on ***logical reasoning with large language models*** (e.g., GPT3 and ChatGPT). The work will be submitted to top conferences like ICLR. 

The RAs need to work *on-campus* (at least 3 months for the summer) at TTIC. If you come from out-of-US or out-of-Chicago, I will cover your *relocation and living expenses*. 

Prior research experience is ***not*** required: actually, most of my previous RAs published their first papers with me. But I expect a qualified RA to be
- highly self-driven; 
- independent; 
- persistent; 
- hard-working; 
- comfortable with constantly learning new things. 

For technical skills, I think the RAs should
- code fluently in Python
- familiar with PyTorch (familiarity with Huggingface is a plus) 
- be comfortable writing in LaTex 

Or they should learn these *fast*.
